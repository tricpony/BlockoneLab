# BlockoneLab

This project is based on services from web services hosted by Blockone.  The data returned represents an eos blockchain, its blocks,
and transactions.  The refresh botton on the navigation bar will load 20 of the most recently executed blocks on the chain.  Search will
filter on the producer of the block.
